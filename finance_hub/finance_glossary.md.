# 📖 Student Finance Glossary

To make data-driven decisions about your future, you need to understand these key terms:

* **Compound Interest:** The interest you earn on interest. This is why starting to save at 16 is better than starting at 26.
* **Debt-to-Income Ratio:** A metric used to see if you can afford a loan (like a student loan).
* **Liquid Assets:** Cash or things you can turn into cash quickly for emergencies.
* **Diversification:** Spreading your money across different areas to reduce risk—just like MindBridge spreads support across Mental Health and Academics.
